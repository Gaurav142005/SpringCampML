We use K Nearest Neighbours Regression technique in the model to predict the sale prices. For this we first pre process the data - We engineer some features with most correlation with the Sale Price data.

**Features:-** 
Subclass
Total Surface Area
Total Rooms Above Grade
Overall Quality
Bathing Facilities
Garage Area
Luxuries
Foundation of the house
All the above features either had a very high correlation with the Sale Price of the house, or logically made sense to be in the interest of a house buyer.
