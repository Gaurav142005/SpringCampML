We use K Nearest Neighbours Regression technique in the model to predict the sale prices. For this we first pre process the data - We engineer some features with most correlation with the Sale Price data.

**Features:-** 
Subclass
<br>Total Surface Area
<br>Total Rooms Above Grade
<br>Overall Quality
<br>Bathing Facilities
<br>Garage Area
<br>Luxuries
<br>Foundation of the house
<br>All the above features either had a very high correlation with the Sale Price of the house, or logically made sense to be in the interest of a house buyer.
