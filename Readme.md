We use K Nearest Neighbours Regression technique in the model to predict the sale prices. For this we first pre process the data - We engineer some features with most correlation with the Sale Price data.

<br>**Features:-** 
<br>Subclass - Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale
<br>Total Surface Area - Sum of all surface areas
<br>Total Rooms Above Grade
<br>Overall Quality (Rating of the house)
<br>Bathing Facilities - 1 contribution of Full Bath, 0.5 for Half bath
<br>Garage Area - Total Garage Surface Area
<br>Luxuries - Various luxuries available to the buyer
<br>Foundation of the house
<br>All the above features either had a very high correlation with the Sale Price of the house, or logically made sense to be in the interest of a house buyer.
